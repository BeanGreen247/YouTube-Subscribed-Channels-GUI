1. Update the Google API libraries to the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib tk
```

2. After updating the libraries, try running your code again with the `run_local_server()` method.

If you're still encountering issues, it might be helpful to create a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies and ensure that you're using the updated libraries within that environment. Here's how you can set up a virtual environment and install the required libraries:

1. Create a virtual environment (replace `venv` with your preferred environment name):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required libraries within the virtual environment:

```bash
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
```

4. Run your script within the activated virtual environment.

If you still face issues after these steps, please provide more information about your environment, the versions of the libraries you're using, and any other relevant details. This will help in diagnosing the problem accurately.

1. **Go to the Google Cloud Console:**
   
   Visit the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).

2. **Select Your Project:**

   If you haven't created a project yet, create one. If you have a project, select it from the dashboard.

3. **Navigate to OAuth Consent Screen:**

   In the left sidebar, navigate to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen."

4. **Configure Consent Screen:**

   Fill out the required information for the OAuth consent screen, including the "App name," "User support email," and other details. Make sure you provide clear and accurate information.

5. **Add Scopes:**

   Under "Scopes for Google APIs," make sure you've added the necessary scopes required for your application. In your case, you're using the YouTube Data API, so you should include the scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly`.

6. **Test Users:**

   You can add email addresses of users who will be testing your application during the verification process. This will allow them to access the application even before the verification is completed.

7. **Submit for Verification:**

   Once you've configured the consent screen, you can submit it for verification. Click the "Submit for verification" button at the bottom of the page.

8. **Wait for Verification:**

   Google's verification process may take some time. You will receive emails from Google regarding the status of the verification. Be sure to respond to any additional requests for information from Google.

9. **Verification Completed:**

   Once your consent screen is verified, you should receive an email confirmation. After that, your application should be able to access Google services without the "Access blocked" error.


1. **Add Scopes:**

   When you create or edit your OAuth consent screen, there should be a section to add "Scopes for Google APIs." You need to add the scope that corresponds to the permissions your application requires. In your case, you should add `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly` since you're accessing the YouTube Data API.

2. **Test Users:**

   During the verification process, you might have an option to provide test user accounts. These are email addresses that Google will allow to access your application even before it's fully verified. This is helpful for testing while you wait for verification.

3. **Submit for Verification:**

   There should be a button or option to "Submit for Verification" within the OAuth consent screen configuration page. When you click this, Google will initiate the review process for your application. You might be asked to provide additional information about your application and how it uses the requested permissions.

4. **Wait for Verification:**

   The verification process duration can vary. You'll likely receive emails from Google regarding the status of your verification. They might request additional information or clarification. Be sure to respond promptly and accurately to any inquiries.

5. **Verification Completed:**

   Once your application is verified, you should receive an email confirmation from Google. This will typically contain instructions on how to proceed and how to ensure your application adheres to any policies or requirements.

Since the verification process can be specific to your application, I strongly recommend referring to Google's official documentation for detailed and up-to-date instructions:

- [OAuth Consent Screen Verification](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app#consent-screen)
- [YouTube Data API Documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application)

Additionally, you might want to consult Google's support resources or forums for assistance if you encounter specific issues during the verification process.
